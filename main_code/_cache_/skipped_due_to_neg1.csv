"Tutor: Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: Kamil wants to renovate his kitchen at home. For this purpose, he hired two professionals who work for him 6 hours a day for 7 days. What does it cost Kamil to hire these professionals if one of them is paid $15 per hour of work? 
 Student: The two professionals work together for 6 x 2 = 12 hours a day.
They work for a total of 12 x 7 = 84 hours in 7 days.
So, the first professional earns a total of 15 x 84 = $1260 for the entire work.
Since there are two professionals, Kamil pays a total of 1260 x 2 = $2520 for their entire work.
 2520 
 Tutor: could you please walk me through your solution? 
 Student: Sure. I started by calculating the total number of hours worked by both professionals. I multiplied 6 hours by 2 which gives us 12 hours a day. Then I multiplied 12 hours by 7 days which gives us 84 hours in total. Then I calculated the amount earned by the first professional for the entire work which is 15 x 84 = $1260. Finally since there are two professionals I multiplied 1260 by 2 which gives us a total of $2520 for their entire work. 
 Tutor: But you have already accounted for both of them in the first step that is 12 hours per day. Why are you multiplying again in the last step? 
 Student: Oh I see. I was multiplying the total amount earned by the first professional for the entire work which is 15 x 84 = $1260 by 2 to get the total amount paid by Kamil for both professionals. So the total amount paid by Kamil is $1260 x 2 = $2520.",mistral,"['mistake_identification_point', 'mistake_location_point', 'revealing_answer_point', 'providing_guidance_point', 'coherent_point', 'actionability_point', 'tutor_tone_point', 'humanness_point']"
"Tutor: Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: Tom originally was only able to lift 80  kg farmer handles per hand.  After some training, he was able to double this number.  He then decided to specialize and was able to get an extra 10%.  How much weight can he hold in total?
 Student: Tom was originally able to lift 80 kg per hand.
After training, he was able to lift 80 x 2 = 160 kg per hand.
After specializing, he can lift an extra 10%, which is 0.1 x 160 = 16 kg more per hand.
So, Tom can now lift a total of 160 + 16 = 176 kg in total.
 176 
 Tutor: What is the solution to this
 Student: The solution is 176 kg
 Tutor: How did you get there 
 Student: Tom was originally able to lift 80 kg per hand. After training, he was able to lift 80 x 2 = 160 kg per hand. After specializing, he can lift an extra 10%, which is 0.1 x 160 = 16 kg more per hand.

"Tutor: Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: A small store made 50 posters to advertise their products. Two-fifths of them are small posters while half of them are medium posters. The rest are large posters. How many large posters are there? 
 Student: Two-fifths of the posters are small, which means 3/5 of them are either medium or large.
Let x be the total number of medium and large posters.
So 2/5x is the number of small posters.
And 2/5x + 50 = x is the total number of posters.
Solving for x, we get x = 80.
Therefore, there are 80 - 50 = 30 large posters.
 30 
 Tutor: You have the first part correct at 20 
 Student: Yes, I got that right. But then I got confused about the total number of posters and I ended up with the wrong answer. 
 Tutor: So half of 50 are medium added to 20 
 Student: Yes, that's right. So the total number of posters would be 70 and the number of large posters would be 70 - 50 = 20.",mistral,"['mistake_identification_point', 'mistake_location_point', 'revealing_answer_point', 'providing_guidance_point', 'coherent_point', 'actionability_point', 'tutor_tone_point', 'humanness_point']"
"Tutor: Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: Apple can run at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Mac can run at a rate of 4 miles per hour. In minutes, how much faster will Mac run a 24 mile race? 
 Student: Apple can run 3 x 60 = 180 miles per minute.
Mac can run 4 x 60 = 240 miles per minute.
The difference in their rates is 240 - 180 = 60 miles per minute.
To run a 24 mile race, Mac will run it 24/60 = 0.4 minutes faster than Apple.
Converting 0.4 minutes to seconds gives us 0.4 x 60 = 24 seconds.",mistral,"['mistake_identification_point', 'mistake_location_point', 'revealing_answer_point', 'providing_guidance_point', 'coherent_point', 'actionability_point', 'tutor_tone_point', 'humanness_point']"
"Tutor: Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: In a graduation ceremony, each graduate can bring their 2 parents. Twenty Tutors and half as many administrators will also attend the graduation ceremony. If there are 50 graduates, how many chairs must be prepared for the ceremony?
 Student: There will be 50 x 2 = 100 parents attending the graduation ceremony.
There will be 20/2 = 10 administrators attending the graduation ceremony.
There will be a total of 50 + 20 + 10 = 80 people attending the graduation ceremony.
Therefore, 80 chairs must be prepared for the ceremony.
 80 
 Tutor: Hello, Romy! Please walk me through your solution 
 Student: Sure. I started by calculating the number of parents attending the graduation ceremony. I multiplied 50 graduates by 2, which gave me 100. Then, I divided the number of administrators by 2, which gave me 10. Finally, I added these three numbers together to get the total number of people attending the ceremony, which was 80. Therefore, 80 chairs must be prepared for the ceremony.",mistral,"['mistake_identification_point', 'mistake_location_point', 'revealing_answer_point', 'providing_guidance_point', 'coherent_point', 'actionability_point', 'tutor_tone_point', 'humanness_point']"

"Tutor: Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: Amiyah is cutting some trees to build a cow shade. For every tree she cuts, she plants 5 new trees. If there were 400 trees on her farm and she cut 20% of them, calculate the total number of trees on the farm. 
 Student: If there were 400 trees on the farm, and Amiyah cut down 20% of them, she cut 20/100*400 = 80 trees.
If Amiyah plants 5 new trees for every tree she cuts down, she planted 5*80 = 400 new trees.
The total number of trees on the farm now is 400+400 = 800 trees.
 800 
 Tutor: You made a good start but there is a small problem with your final step.  Can you see it? 
 Student: Yes I think I made a mistake when I added the 400 trees. I should have added 800 instead. 
 Tutor: Why would you add 800?   
 Student: Because I cut 80 trees and planted 400 new trees so the total number of trees on the farm is 800.",mistral,"['mistake_identification_point', 'mistake_location_point', 'revealing_answer_point', 'providing_guidance_point', 'coherent_point', 'actionability_point', 'tutor_tone_point', 'humanness_point']"
"Tutor: Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her? 
 Student: The first bid was $200 and each subsequent bid is $50 more, so the second bid is $200 + $50 = $250, the third bid is $250 + $50 = $300, and the fourth bid is $300 + $50 = $350.
Carmen bid after each of the other 3 people, so she made 3 bids in total.
Therefore, the desk cost her $350, since that was her winning bid.
 350 
 Tutor: Explain your solution 
 Student: My solution was that the desk cost Carmen $350 because the first bid was $200 and each subsequent bid was $50 more. So the second bid was $200 + $50 = $250, the third bid was $250 + $50 = $300, and the fourth bid was $300 + $50 = $350. Carmen bid after each of the other 3 people, so she made 3 bids in total and her winning bid was $350.",mistral,"['mistake_identification_point', 'mistake_location_point', 'revealing_answer_point', 'providing_guidance_point', 'coherent_point', 'actionability_point', 'tutor_tone_point', 'humanness_point']"
"Tutor: Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people? 
 Student: To serve 20 people, Tyson needs to make 20/4 = 5 sandwiches.
Each sandwich requires 1+1 = 2 pounds of meat and cheese.
For 5 sandwiches, he needs a total of 2 x 5 = 10 pounds of meat and cheese.
The cost of 10 pounds of meat is 10 x $7.00 = $70.
The cost of 10 pounds of cheese is 10 x $3.00 = $30.
The total cost of meat and cheese is $70 + $30 = $100.

"Tutor: Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: The number of Christmas presents David found was twice as many as the number of birthday presents. If David found a total of 60 Christmas presents, how many presents did he get all together? 
 Student: Let's call the number of birthday presents ""x"". 
According to the problem, the number of Christmas presents is twice as many as the number of birthday presents, so:
Number of Christmas presents = 2x 
We also know that the total number of presents is 60:
Total number of presents = x + 2x = 3x 
So, 3x = 60 
To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: 
x = 20 
Now we can find the total number of presents: 
Total number of presents = x + 2x = 3x = 3(20) = 60 
 60 
 Tutor: can you tell me how you got your answer? 
 Student: Yes I used the equation 3x = 60 and then divided both sides by 3 to get x = 20. Then I added the number of birthday presents (x) and the number of Christmas presents (2x) to get the total number of presents which was 3x = 60. 
 Tutor: Ok. If David found 60 Christmas presents and that was 2x the number of the birthday presents how many birthday presents did he get? 
 Student: Since the number of Christmas presents was twice as many as the number of birthday presents then the number of birthday presents must be x = 20. 
 Tutor: What is 60 divided by 2?
 Student: 60 divided by 2 is 30.",mistral,"['mistake_identification_point', 'mistake_location_point', 'revealing_answer_point', 'providing_guidance_point', 'coherent_point', 'actionability_point', 'tutor_tone_point', 'humanness_point']"
"Tutor: Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books? 
 Student: Peter can read one book in 18 hours, so Kristin can read one book in 18 x 3 = 54 hours.
Kristin needs to read half of her books, which is 20/2 = 10 books.
So, Kristin will need 10 x 54 = 540 hours to read half of her books.
Therefore, Kristin will need 540/20 = 27 hours per book.
To read half of her books, Kristin will need 27 x 10 = 270 hours.
 270 
 Tutor: what is the question asking us for? 
 Student: The question is asking us how long it will take Kristin to read half of her books.

 Student: Half of the books is 10 books. 
 Tutor: how long does she take to read a book? 
 Student: Kristin takes 27 hours to read one book. 
 Tutor: Where did you get this number
 Student: I got this number by dividing the total time it takes Peter to read one book (18 hours) by 3 since Peter reads three times as fast as Kristin. 
 Tutor: if Peter reads faster should it take more or less time? 
 Student: Since Peter reads faster it should take less time for Kristin to read her books.",mistral,"['mistake_identification_point', 'mistake_location_point', 'revealing_answer_point', 'providing_guidance_point', 'actionability_point', 'tutor_tone_point', 'humanness_point']"
